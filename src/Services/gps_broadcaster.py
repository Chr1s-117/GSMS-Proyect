GPS Data Broadcasting Service

This module implements a thread-safe buffered broadcaster that manages
real-time GPS data distribution to WebSocket clients.

Key Features:
- Thread-safe buffering with locks and events
- Automatic retry mechanism when no clients are connected
- Integration with GPSWebSocketManager for real-time updates
- Logging of broadcast events via log_ws

Architecture:
    UDP/HTTP → Repository (DB insert) → add_gps() → Buffer → WebSocket Clients
    
    Flow:
    1. GPS data is inserted into database
    2. add_gps() is called to add data to broadcast buffer
    3. Broadcast loop wakes up and processes buffer
    4. Data is sent to all connected WebSocket clients
    5. If no clients, data remains in buffer for retry

Thread Safety:
    - Uses threading.Lock for buffer access
    - Uses threading.Event for efficient wake-up
    - Safe to call add_gps() from any thread (UDP, HTTP handlers, etc.)

Usage:
    # From UDP receiver or HTTP endpoint
    from src.Services.gps_broadcaster import add_gps
    
    gps_dict = {
        "DeviceID": "TRUCK-001",
        "Latitude": 10.9878,
        "Longitude": -74.7889,
        "Timestamp": "2025-01-27T06:04:54Z",
        "CurrentGeofenceID": "warehouse-001",
        "CurrentGeofenceName": "Main Warehouse",
        "GeofenceEventType": "entry"
    }
    
    add_gps(gps_dict)  # Non-blocking, thread-safe

Performance:
    - Buffer size is unlimited (memory bounded by GPS insertion rate)
    - Typical latency: <10ms from add_gps() to WebSocket send
    - Event-driven (no polling), minimal CPU usage when idle
