"""
Response WebSocket Manager

Manages WebSocket connections for broadcasting request responses to clients.

This manager handles the response channel in the request-response pattern:
1. Client sends request via request_ws.py
2. Request is processed by request_handlers.py
3. Response is queued in response_broadcaster.py
4. Response is sent via this manager to response_ws clients

Features:
- Thread-safe response broadcasting
- Client connection tracking
- Request-response correlation via request_id
- Automatic message routing to all connected clients

Integration:
- Used by response_broadcaster.py to send responses
- Receives responses from request handlers
- Broadcasts to frontend clients waiting for responses

Usage:
    from src.Core.response_ws import response_from_thread
    
    response_dict = {
        "action": "get_devices",
        "request_id": "req-12345",
        "status": "success",
        "data": {"devices": [...], "count": 25}
    }
    
    response_from_thread(response_dict)  # Thread-safe broadcast

    Thread-safe method to broadcast a response to all connected clients.
    
    This function can be safely called from any thread (UDP receiver,
    background tasks, request handlers) and will properly schedule the
    broadcast on the main FastAPI event loop.
    
    Args:
        data: Response data dictionary with structure:
            {
                "action": "get_devices",
                "request_id": "req-12345",

                "data": {...}
            }
    
    Returns:

            "action": "get_devices",

    Performance:
        - Only sends if clients are connected (avoids unnecessary work)

        - Non-blocking (returns immediately)
    
    Integration:
        - Called by response_broadcaster.py after response_ws_manager.has_clients check
        - Coordinates with request_ws.py for request-response correlation
