class WebSocketManager:
    """
    Base WebSocket manager that handles a group of connected clients.

    Responsibilities:
    - Manage WebSocket client connections (register/unregister).
    - Broadcast messages to all connected clients safely.
    - Provide thread-safe message sending from external (non-async) threads.
    - Optional keep-alive support for long-lived connections.

    Improvements:
    - Thread-safe access to client list using a Lock.
    - Register adds client before ws.accept() to avoid race gap.
    - Safer unregister (idempotent).
    - Prepared for future alive-check (ping/pong).

    Subclasses should override `handle_message()` to implement
    custom logic for processing incoming client messages.
