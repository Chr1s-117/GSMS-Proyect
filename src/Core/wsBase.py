Base WebSocket Manager

Thread-safe base class for managing WebSocket connections with support for
concurrent access from multiple threads (UDP receiver, background tasks, etc.).

Key Features:
- Thread-safe client list management using threading.Lock
- Safe register/unregister with race condition protection
- Thread-safe broadcasting from non-async threads
- Automatic cleanup of failed connections
- Extensible message handling for subclasses

Thread Safety:
All operations that access or modify the client list are protected by a lock,
ensuring safe concurrent access from:
- FastAPI WebSocket handlers (async)
- UDP receiver thread
- Background monitoring tasks
- Broadcaster services

Architecture:
This base class is extended by:
- GpsWebSocketManager (gps_ws.py)
- LogWebSocketManager (log_ws.py)
- RequestWebSocketManager (request_ws.py)
- ResponseWebSocketManager (response_ws.py)

Usage:
    # Subclass implementation
    class MyWebSocketManager(WebSocketManager):
        async def handle_message(self, ws: WebSocket, message: str):
            # Custom message handling logic
            print(f"Received: {message}")
    
    # In main.py lifespan
    my_manager = MyWebSocketManager()
    my_manager.set_main_loop(asyncio.get_running_loop())
    
    # WebSocket endpoint
    @app.websocket("/ws/my-endpoint")
    async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
        await my_manager.register(websocket)
        try:
            while True:
                message = await websocket.receive_text()
                await my_manager.handle_message(websocket, message)
        except WebSocketDisconnect:
            my_manager.unregister(websocket)
