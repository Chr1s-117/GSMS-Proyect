Device Management REST API

This module provides REST endpoints for managing GPS devices (registration,
activation/deactivation, updates, and statistics).

Endpoints:
- GET    /devices/              List all devices (with filters)
- POST   /devices/              Register new device
- GET    /devices/{device_id}   Get device details
- PATCH  /devices/{device_id}   Update device information
- DELETE /devices/{device_id}   Deactivate device (soft delete)
- GET    /devices/{device_id}/stats  Get device statistics

Security:
- Device registration should be restricted (authentication required in production)
- Only active devices can send GPS data (validated in UDP receiver)
- Deactivation preserves historical GPS data

Integration:
- Used by UDP receiver to validate incoming GPS data
- Used by frontend for device selection dropdowns
- Used by admin panel for device management

Usage:
    # In main.py
    from src.Controller.Routes import devices
    app.include_router(devices.router, prefix="/devices", tags=["devices"])
